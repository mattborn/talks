## Web Components

- Good encapsulation = components only know about themselves
- Community consensus = ES6 modules (next version of JS), [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org), AMD, CommonJS, Require, Webpack, Browserify, React …
- Not a library, but an architectural design pattern
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
## Facebook Evangelism

- We haven’t actually separated concerns, we separated technologies.
- If the markup changes, we still have to change the styles.
- “We believe colocating style with your JS is a good idea.”
- “It turns out that if you write your styles in JS, a large class of really hard problems with CSS just disappear instantly.”
- Instead of focusing on what has changed, let’s focus on what is different.

## In Javascript We Trust

- We already use Javascript for events + DOM manipulation.
- Javascript can create elements.
- Javascript can style elements.
- Javascript is an expressive language that already has everything LESS + SASS are trying to account for.

## 7 problems with CSS at scale not addressed by LESS + SASS

1. Global Namespace
2. Dependencies
3. Dead Code Elimination
4. Minification
5. Sharing Constants
6. Non-deterministic Resolution
7. Isolation

## The React Way

- Why not do everything like we did in the 90s?
- React says just re-render everything every time something changes, but only update what’s different.
- Let’s make expressing markup native without templates + bind our events directly as well.
- Hell, why not bring inline styles back like it’s 1999?

## Cascading Style Shits

Could be unnecessarily abrasive.

## What it is not.

Inline styles do not represent an alternative for the systematic design, implementation and governance of consistent coding standards, tooling, or processes.

We may have reached a metaphorical crossroads, but it is less of a everything-we-think-we-know-is-wrong and more of a make-sure-we-understand-decisions-that-were-made-for-us.

Also not talking about number of HTTP requests, payload sizes, rule and selector limits.

## Concerns

- Document vs. application
- Straight-forward vs. nuanced

- Less magic + fewer concerns
- Explicit vs. implicit (designers tend misinterpret Good design is obvious, great design is transparent)
- Vanilla CSS vs. LESS vs. Sass vs. ?
- Naming conventions for selectors: OOCSS, ACSS, BEM, SMACSS, etc.
- Naming will always be hard, but do we really need to involve ourselves with the adoption, education + maintenance of all these competing approaches?
- Dead code removal

- Who spends the most time maintaining?
- Influence vs. execution
- Telephone game: Backlog → UX → UI → Prototype → Engineering + QA → Production → Support
- Which party has the greatest influence on what actually makes it to production and how
- What could be → what is + what will be → what should be

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. —Phil Karlton

## Big takeaways

- Better encapsulation
